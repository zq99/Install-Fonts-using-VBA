# Install Fonts using VBA

This is a simple class that can be added to an Excel VBA project, that will handle loading a custom font file when the workbook is opened.

## Setup

Add the font install class to a VBA project.

The ThisWorkbook module is an example of how to call the class when a Excel VBA project is first opened.

You should change the name of "MyFontFile.ttf" to be the name of your font file.
